summary: Test of the default charset in mariadb-connector-c.
description: |
    Description:

    The goal of this test is to verify, that the change of version of
    the mariadb-connector-c component from 3.1 to 3.2 does not break
    access to mariadb, which has the mariadb-connector-c compiled inside.

    Among other, the version bump of mariadb-conenctor-c to 3.2 includes change
    of the default charset to utf8mb4.
    Test checks, if the change breaks something. Test should be run with every
    relevant package's version bump.
